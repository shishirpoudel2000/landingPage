            <pr>My goal for the future is to become a computer programmer.
                 Becoming a computer programmer would be great because there are many options in this career by having the ability to produce an operating system or a game for the world. 
                 Computer programmers have many opportunities in life to find a job they would love.
                 Programmers can work independently or in a big company. Programmers have and are creating the future for computers.</pr> 
            <pr>Many jobs need some sort of qualifications to work at that specific job. As a programmer, the person may not go very far if they only have a high school degree.
                 Most employers require programmers to have at least a bachelor’s degree. Some higher-ranking jobs may even require a master’s degree.
                 Some qualifications may be as simple as having a certain amount of experience. With an advanced degree and certain knowledge, a person can become a computer programmer.
                 At a young age, I decided I wanted to become a computer programmer. As time passed by, I started to like it more. 
                 I am currently a studing in college, and I am really happy with the career I have chosen. My short term goal is to learn as much as pussible about programming.
                 My long-term goal is to obtain my bachelor degree and get a job as a computer programmer.</pr>
